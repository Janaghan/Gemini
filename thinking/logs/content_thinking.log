Here is an explanation of Occam's Razor, broken down into a clear definition and a simple example.\n\n### What is Occam's Razor?\n\n**Occam's Razor** is a problem-solving principle that states: **\"Among competing hypotheses, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected.\"**\n\nIn simpler terms, it means that the most straightforward explanation is usually the right one. It's a mental tool, or a \"heuristic,\" that helps you choose the most likely explanation when you're faced with several possibilities.\n\nIt *doesn't* say the simplest explanation is *always* true, but it suggests that you shouldn't invent complicated, elaborate theories when a simple one will do. The core idea is to \"shave away\" unnecessary assumptions.\n\nThe principle is named after William of Ockham, a 14th-century philosopher, who famously wrote (in Latin) that \"Entities should not be multiplied beyond necessity.\"\n\n---\n\n### A Simple, Everyday Example: The Broken Vase\n\nImagine you come home from work and find your favorite vase shattered on the floor. Your dog is sitting nearby, looking guilty.\n\nYou think of two possible explanations:\n\n*   **Hypothesis 1 (The Simple Explanation):** The dog was running around, wagged its tail too hard, and knocked the vase off the table.\n\n*   **Hypothesis 2 (The Complex Explanation):** A small, localized earthquake, too faint for anyone else in the city to notice, shook just your apartment, causing the vase to fall. After the shaking stopped, the dog came over to investigate the noise.\n\n**Applying Occam's Razor:**\n\nTo believe **Hypothesis 1**, you only need to make a few common assumptions:\n*   Dogs are sometimes clumsy.\n*   Your dog was in the room.\n\nTo believe **Hypothesis 2**, you have to make many large and unlikely assumptions:\n*   An earthquake occurred.\n*   It was so specific that it only affected your apartment.\n*   It was strong enough to knock over a vase but not disturb anything else.\n*   The dog\u2019s presence is just a coincidence.\n\nOccam's Razor tells you to \"shave away\" the unnecessary assumptions. Hypothesis 2 requires inventing a secret earthquake. Hypothesis 1 relies on the known behavior of a dog. Therefore, the most logical conclusion is that the dog broke the vase. It's the simplest explanation and the most likely to be correct.", "model": "gemini-2.5-pro", "latency_ms": 19.7}
