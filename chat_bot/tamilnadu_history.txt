Tamil Nadu History

Tamil Nadu, meaning "Tamil Country," has a rich history dating back to the Upper Paleolithic age (15,000–10,000 BCE). The region is the home of the Tamils, descendants of the Dravidians who settled in the south between 2000 and 1500 BCE.

Ancient Dynasties:
The history is defined by three major dynasties:
1.  **The Cheras**
2.  **The Cholas**
3.  **The Pandyas**

These kingdoms contributed to some of the world's oldest literature and were often in conflict for dominance. The Pandyas are mentioned in Greek literature as early as the 4th century BCE.

Medieval Period:
-   **Kalabhras:** Invaded in the 3rd century CE, displacing the traditional rulers.
-   **Pallavas:** Emerged around 550 CE under King Simhavishnu, establishing Kanchipuram as a major power center.
-   **Chola Empire:** Re-emerged in the 9th century, becoming a dominant force in the southern peninsula and extending influence to Southeast Asia.
-   **Vijayanagara Empire:** Gained control from the late 14th to 16th centuries.
-   **Nayakas of Madurai:** Became independent in the early 1600s.
-   **Maratha Empire:** Expanded into northern Tamil Nadu in the 17th and 18th centuries.

Colonial Era & Modern History:
-   European trade ports were established in the 17th century.
-   The **Madras Presidency** was formed by the British in the late 18th century.
-   After India's independence in 1947, it became **Madras State**.
