Let's solve this puzzle step-by-step.\n\nHere is the solution:\n\n*   **Alice** lives in the **blue house**. She does not own a cat or a dog.\n*   **Bob** lives in the **red house** and owns a **cat**.\n*   **Carol** lives in the **green house** and owns a **dog**.\n\n### Here's how we can figure it out:\n\n1.  **Find who lives in the red house:** The puzzle states the person in the red house owns a cat. We also know two key facts:\n    *   Carol owns a dog, so she can't live in the red house.\n    *   Alice does not own a cat, so she can't live in the red house either.\n    *   By elimination, **Bob must live in the red house**.\n\n2.  **Determine Bob's pet:** Since Bob lives in the red house, he must be the one who **owns the cat**.\n\n3.  **Place the remaining people and houses:**\n    *   We now know Bob is in the red house. This leaves Alice and Carol for the green and blue houses.\n    *   The puzzle says the green house is to the left of the red house.\n    *   We know Carol owns a dog. Since Bob and his cat are in the red house, and Alice is in the remaining house, this means **Carol lives in the green house with her dog**.\n\n4.  **Find Alice's house:** By elimination, the only person and house left are Alice and the blue house. Therefore, **Alice lives in the blue house**.", "model": "gemini-2.5-pro", "latency_ms": 88.03}
